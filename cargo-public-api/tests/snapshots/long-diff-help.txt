Diff the public API against a published version of the crate, or between commits.

If the diffing

* arg looks like a specific version string (`x.y.z`) then the diff will be between that published
  version of the crate and the working directory.

* arg has `..` like in `tag1..tag2` then the public API of each individual git commit will be
  diffed. See below for how that works.

* args end with `.json` like in `file1.json file2.json` then rustdoc JSON file diffing will be
  performed.


EXAMPLES:
=========

Diff a published version of a crate against the current working tree:

    cargo public-api diff 1.2.3

Diff the latest version of a crate against the current working tree:

    cargo public-api diff latest

Diff between two published versions of any crate:

    cargo public-api -p example_api diff 0.1.0 0.2.0

Diff current working tree version of `specific-crate` against published version 1.2.3:

    cargo public-api -p specific-crate diff 1.2.3

Diff between commits:

    cargo public-api diff v0.2.0..v0.3.0

Diff between rustdoc JSON files:

    cargo public-api diff first.json second.json


HOW COMMIT DIFFING WORKS:
=========================

When diffing commits, the following steps are performed:

1. Remember the current branch/commit
2. Do a literal in-tree, in-place `git checkout` of the first commit
3. Collect public API
4. Do a literal in-tree, in-place `git checkout` of the second commit
5. Collect public API
6. Print the diff between public API in step 2 and step 4
7. Restore the original branch/commit

If you have local changes, git will refuse to do `git checkout`, so your work will not be discarded.
To force `git checkout`, use `--force`.

Using the current git repo has the benefit of making it likely for the build to succeed. If we e.g.
were to git clone a temporary copy of a commit ourselves, the risk is high that additional steps are
needed before a build can succeed. Such as the need to set up git submodules.

Usage: cargo public-api diff [OPTIONS] [ARGS]...

Arguments:
  [ARGS]...
          What to diff.
          
          EXAMPLES
          ========
          
          Diff current working tree version of `specific-crate` against published version 1.2.3:
          
              cargo public-api -p specific-crate diff 1.2.3
          
          Diff between commits:
          
              cargo public-api diff v0.2.0..v0.3.0
          
          See
          
              cargo public-api diff --help
          
          for more examples and more info.

Options:
      --deny <DENY>
          Exit with failure if the specified API diff is detected.
          
          Can be combined. For example, to only allow additions to the API, use `--deny=added
          --deny=changed`.

          Possible values:
          - all:     All forms of API diffs are denied: additions, changes, deletions
          - added:   Deny added things in API diffs
          - changed: Deny changed things in API diffs
          - removed: Deny removed things in API diffs

      --manifest-path <PATH>
          Path to `Cargo.toml`
          
          [default: Cargo.toml]

      --force
          Force the diff. For example, when diffing commits, enabling this option will discard
          working tree changes during git checkouts of other commits

  -p, --package <PACKAGE>
          Name of package in workspace to list or diff the public API for

  -s, --simplified...
          Omit noisy items. Can be used more than once.
          
          | Usage | Corresponds to                                           |
          |-------|----------------------------------------------------------|
          | -s    | --omit blanket-impls                                     |
          | -ss   | --omit blanket-impls,auto-trait-impls                    |
          | -sss  | --omit blanket-impls,auto-trait-impls,auto-derived-impls |

      --omit <OMIT>
          Omit specified items

          Possible values:
          - blanket-impls:      Omit items that belong to Blanket Implementations such as `impl<T>
            Any for T`, `impl<T> Borrow<T> for T`, and `impl<T, U> Into<U> for T where U: From<T>`
          - auto-trait-impls:   Omit items that belong to Auto Trait Implementations such as `impl
            Send for ...`, `impl Sync for ...`, and `impl Unpin for ...`
          - auto-derived-impls: Omit items that belong to Auto Derived Implementations such as
            `Clone`, `Debug`, and `Eq`

  -F, --features <FEATURES>
          Space or comma separated list of features to activate

      --all-features
          Activate all available features

      --no-default-features
          Do not activate the `default` feature

      --target <TARGET>
          Build for the target triple

      --color [<COLOR>]
          When to color the output.
          
          By default, `--color=auto` is active. Using just `--color` without an arg is equivalent to
          `--color=always`.

          Possible values:
          - auto:   Colors will be used if stdout is a terminal. Colors will not be used if stdout
            is a regular file
          - never:  Colors will never be used
          - always: Colors will always be used

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
