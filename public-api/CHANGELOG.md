# Changelog

Please see the [Releases](https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api/releases) page for a list of all releases and what they contain. The changes that affect this library are put under the "public_api library" header.

Let me know if you would really like to have that list inside this file, and why so. A dynamically constructed and always up to date list seems like a better approach.
