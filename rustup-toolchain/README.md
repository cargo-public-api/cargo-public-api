# rustup-toolchain

A library for programmatically working with `rustup` toolchains.

Please refer to the [docs](https://docs.rs/rustup-toolchain/latest) to learn more.

## Changelog

Please refer to [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cargo-public-api/cargo-public-api/blob/main/rustup-toolchain/CHANGELOG.md).

## Tests

This library is indirectly and heavily tested through the [`public-api`](https://crates.io/crates/public-api) and [`cargo-public-api`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-public-api) test suites. Their tests heavily depend on this library, so if all of their tests pass, then this library works as it should.

All tests are of course ensured to pass before a new release of this crate is made.
